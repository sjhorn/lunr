I have just finished porting [lunrjs](https://lunrjs.com) to dart/flutter and wanted to ensure other can take advantage of this interesting library. 

I have been able to compare the index and search json output between the two for some moderately sized json such as the [movies.json](https://github.com/prust/wikipedia-movie-data) and they are identical. 

Please [let me know](https://github.com/sjhorn/lunr/issues) if you find this useful or if you see bugs that I will aim to fix
