### Getting Started

![Lunr image](../assets/images/undraw_in_real_life_v8fk.svg)

First we will walk you through setting up your first search index with Lunr. It assumes you have some familiarity with JavaScript. After finishing this guide you will have a script that will be able to perform a search on a collection of documents.


### Installation

Install Lunr with pub.dev

Dart:
```sh
dart pub add lunr
```

Flutter:
```sh
flutter pub add lunr
```

### Creating and index

We will create a simple index on a collection of documents and then perform searches on those documents.

First, we need a collection of documents. A document is a `Map<String, String>` object. It should have an identifier field that Lunr will use to tell us which documents in the collection matched a search, as well as any other fields that we want to search on.

```dart
List<Map<String,String>> documents = [{
  "name": "Lunr",
  "text": "Like Solr, but much smaller, and not as bright."
}, {
  "name": "React",
  "text": "A JavaScript library for building user interfaces."
}, {
  "name": "Lodash",
  "text": "A modern JavaScript utility library delivering "
}];
```
We will use the above list of documents to build our index. We want to search the text field, and the name field will be our identifier. Letâ€™s define our index and add these documents to it.

After that we will do a simple search and print the results.

```dart
import 'package:lunr/lunr.dart';

void main() {
    List<Map<String,String>> documents = [{
    "name": "Lunr",
    "text": "Like Solr, but much smaller, and not as bright."
    }, {
    "name": "React",
    "text": "A JavaScript library for building user interfaces."
    }, {
    "name": "Lodash",
    "text": "A modern JavaScript utility library delivering "
    }];
    
    // Create the index
    Index idx = lunr((builder) {
        builder.ref = 'name';
        builder.field('text');
        for (var doc in documents) {
            builder.add(doc);
        }
    });

    // Search the index for text bright
    print(idx.search('bright'));
}
```

The results output will look similar to the following:

```
[DocMatch(ref: Lunr, score: 1.042, matchData: 
    MatchData(metadata: {bright: {text: {}}}))]
```
