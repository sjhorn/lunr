Lunr for dart and flutter is based on the source code (version 2.9.2) from the great project by [Oliver Nightingale](https://github.com/olivernn) and maintained by the contributers on [github](https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js). 

This site also borrows from the documentation and style at [lunrjs.com](https://lunrjs.com) and add a dart programming style to it where relevant. 

The goal is:

* Enable learning about full-text search
* Provide a great offline search for Flutter platforms
* Provide reusable library to build upon for other dart/flutter packages
